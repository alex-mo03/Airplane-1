# Airplane-1

Today, there is a duopoly in the long-range and medium-range jet markets, with Boeing and Airbus holding relatively equal pieces of those markets. However, it wasn't always this way.

In the 1970s-80s, there were 3 major US manufacturers in this segment, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed and 1 major European manufacturer, Airbus. Boeing was undeniably the dominant player, but MD and Lockheed's products performed exceptionally well on transcontinental and transatlantic routes, so they still sold in considerable numbers to US and foreign airlines. Airbus was a new company at this time, aimed at the same market that MD and Lockheed were in.

As the 20th century drew to a close, Lockheed's L-1011 was the first to go, despite being packed with futuristic technology at the time of it's release. This futuristic technology became antiquated rather quickly due to the rapid advances of the 80s, and was a maintenance hog at that. At the turn of the century, only Delta, ATA, and a few others were still flying them, many of them being secondhand airplanes. The L-1011's fellow trijet, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 was similarly withdrawn from passenger service rather quickly. However, it was a reliable and cheap airplane to maintain and fly, meaning that, while the L-1011 faded into history, the DC-10 and its modernized variant the MD-11 would go on to form the backbone of many cargo airlines worldwide. Today, only one L-1011 remains airworthy, an airborne launch pad for Northrop Grumman/Orbital Sciences. Scores of DC-10/MD-11 remain in civilian service as cargo transports. 

It became clear that these trijets were doomed not too long after their release. They did not have the range or capacity of the infamous Boeing 747, and did not have the efficiency of the Boeing 767 and 757, which were more efficient and flew many of the same routes, albeit with less capacity. ETOPS played a role in keeping these trijets competitive just a little longer by restricting the twin-engined 767 and 757 from flying over the Atlantic (or any water for mor e than a length of time) in case of emergency (even though they easily had the range to do so). Three and four-engined jets can lose an engine and still have more than 50 percent thrust remaining.

**Lose one engine = 75% power left**

The introduction of the Boeing 777 was the nail in the coffin. With the elimination of ETOPS in its original form, it could fly domestic and transatlantic routes (later transpacific as well) with the same capacity and better efficiency. The 777 killed the Airbus A340 as well for the exact same reasons. 

## The Turn of the Century

MD merged with Boeing in the late 90s, and Lockheed withdrew itself from civilian endeavors, entering the 21st century as primarily a defense company. This left only Airbus and Boeing. Airbus's A340 had been unsuccessful, but its A330 was very successful and its medium/short range A320 very, very successful indeed. Boeing, on the other hand, had its long-haul 777, 747 and 767(ER), all of which were very, very successful, medium haul 757, and medium/short haul 737, the most popular commercial airplane of all time. It can be said that Airbus was the underdog here. 

Fast forward to now, the 747, 767, 757, A340 and A380 are all but dead, leaving the newest generation (787, A350, A330, 777-200/300, 737NG and MAX, A320neo) to carry the industry into the future. Some pre-1990 airplanes are still in cargo use, but they are gone from passenger service. The pandemic has caused a massacre of older airframes far before they were meant to be retired. If the aviation recovers after the pandemic, some older frames may be reactivated and have a few more years, but this is pretty much how it will be for a long time. At no other time in history could the vast majority of the industry be summarized in just six types, but the pandemic has made it this way. Scores of 747s, 757s and 767s will soldier on in cargo service, but very soon, none of these will grace the skies any longer.
